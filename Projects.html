		<br/>
		I chose this project because it was one my very first C++ programs. 
		I am the most proud of the fact that it works correctly. I say this because, once again, this was one of
		my first programs. Also, I could have improved on maybe adding more features to it. For example,
		I could have an option below "Press enter to exit" to go back to where you first enter your height in inches instead
		of it just exiting the program so you could easily use it again.

		<p> 
			Hello there! Welcome to my website! The purpose of this website that you have stumbled upon is to showcase my work as I learn new things so that you can see the progress that I have made. 
			I will continue to learn knew things and progress!

	<header><h3>Educational Goal</h3></header> 
	    <p>
		  One long-term educational goal I have is to go to a college of my choice and obtain as much knowledge as I can to become a programmer. I feel as though if I knew more about different programming
		  languages I could do better at programming in general. Another long-term educational goal I have is to also freelance webdesign on the side of being a programmer just in case programming doesn't
		  work out for me at times. If I knew more more about web design I could make better quality websites for people who need them! I plan to do this within 1 to 2 years of graduation. 
	    </p>
	 <header><h3>Employment Goal</h3></header> 
	    <p>
	    	My long-term employment goal is to find a well paying job that suits my life style and allows me to be challanged, but also happy and content with my work. I plan to do this within 5 years 
	    	after graduation. Maybe even within 4 years after graduation. I plan on going with the flow and do whatever life throws at me!
